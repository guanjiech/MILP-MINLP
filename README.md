# MILP-MINLP

I am working on a highly complicated MINLP problem recently in a paper about mobile blockchain, which is my first paper here in ZJU. So I want to record some of my beneficial thoughts here. Besides, I will put all relevant materials used or which I think are precious in this repository.

For now, there mainly remains two kinds of algorithms to solve MINLP. One is ***deterministic optimization algorithm*** while another kind is ***evolution algorithm*** which is problem independent, such as GA, SA, PSO and so on. 

The deterministic optimization algorithm to solve the problem of MINLP mainly includes **single-tree class** and **multi-tree class**. Singlg-tree class has a **Nonlinear Branch and Bound** method and **Nonlinear Branch and cut** method. Multi-tree class is mainly based on **outer approximation method** and **benders decomposition method**.

1. There already remains some mature algorithms for solving **NLP(Non-linear programming)** and **ILP(Integer linear programming)** problems. If you want to catch up on the basics, you can go to [convex optimization](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) from [Stephen P. Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/). There are superdetailed slides and videos here, which is quite beneficial.
2. other materials are included in this reository
